## **Profile**
I am a Machine Learning Engineer with 5 years of experience in Python and 4 years focused on MLOps, with an emphasis on building efficient pipelines and automating Machine Learning processes in different fields such as retail, finance and logistics . I also have 3 years of experience with Google Cloud Platform (GCP), which enables me to develop and scale data solutions in a robust and efficient way. 

Currently, working in Grupo Boticario(Biggest cosmetic e-commerce of LATAM). I am responsible for developing data-driven products that have a positive impact on both the company and its customers. My experience has provided me with significant learning in MLOps and CI/CD pipelines orchestration via AirFlow or VertexAI and also used Git extensively for version control and team collaboration.

Throughout my career, I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects. I developed payment probability scoring models using Python, resulting in a 15-20% increase in effort allocation efficiency. Created analytical dashboards and applied machine learning techniques, such as clustering, to personalize offers to customers and i was responsible for building the data warehouse and creating automated dashboards with VBA, resulting in a 25% increase in the company's monthly revenue.  

With a solid foundation in Python (5 years), MLOps (4 years), and GCP (3 years), I am always looking to improve my technical skills, right now i'm studying especially Deep Learning (Pytorch) and LLMs - LLMOps.
